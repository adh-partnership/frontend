    Welcome to Anchorage ARTCC's Oceanic page! This page is dedicated to helping pilots figure out how ZAN runs its
    Oceanic airspace and what to do. Anchorage's Oceanic Areas are split, one is way up north and is called the Arctic
    Area (defined as an area from 73 degrees to the north pole, and 141 degrees west to 168 degrees 59 minutes west).
    The other is the primary and is named the Pacific Area. The Pacific Area is one of the primary pathways from Asia to
    Alaska, Europe and the greater north.
